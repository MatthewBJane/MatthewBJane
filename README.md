### Hello There!

My name is Matthew and I am a Quantitative Psychology PhD student at the University of Connecticut. I am fairly active on Twitter, you can find me there at @MatthewBJane.

My research interests include:
- Quantitative methods for meta-analysis
- Statistical artifacts and their impact on research findings
- Substantive interests: cognitive ability

Currently Working on {posc} and {ThemePark} packages for R. I also maintain the OpenSynthesis website that catalogs publicly available meta-analytic datasets.
